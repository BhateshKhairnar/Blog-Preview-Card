## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

- Flexbox layout
- Grid


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - This helped me for adding fonts in different ways. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
